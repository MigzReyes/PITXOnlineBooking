	Create a data set that contains the destination, operator (Bus brand) and types bus (lazyboy, sleeper), and images

	Entities:

		Bus		
			- Operator 
			- Type
			- ImgInside
			-ImgOutside


	RECEIPT:
		After succesfull payment, send the JSON OBJECT to the database for permanent data, after that show the data from the database
		to the receipt page.

		ticket no# - will automatically be created after succesfull payment

		date booked - will get the createdAt data

		gate, bay, and trip# - will also be automatically created after succesfull payment



		JSON OBJECT SCHEMA

			USE `sessionStorage` for lcoal storage, to temporarily store user data inside an object.

			- This will be used to store the data, rather than putting the data straigthly into the database, ONLY INSERT THE DATA OF THE USER
			AFTER SUCCESSFUL PAYMENT TO AVOID UNNECESSARY DATA AND DDOS ATTACK. Use the JSON OBJECT to insert the data to the database based	
			on the `key`

			NOTE! ALWAYS NAME THE KEY THE SAME AS THE PROPERTIES (ATTIRBUTES) ON WHICH THE JSON OBJECT SCHEMA IS BASED ON.


		Based on the trip in booking.cshtml get the tripId then if the user click the `book now` use the tripId to get the data from the	
		database to be sent into an object


		Research a destination from PITX and get the average trip time, create a static set of data with fixed trip time

		Example

				PITX to Legazpi is automatically 14 hours, and will usually show within the afternnoon.

				The id of passnger will depend on the id of the user (Main Passenger)
