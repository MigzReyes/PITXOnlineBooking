// BACKEND
	Automate Bus Booking List

	Create a data set that contains the destination, operator (Bus brand) and types bus (lazyboy, sleeper), and images

	Entities:

		Bus		
			- Operator 
			- Type
			- ImgInside
			-ImgOutside


	RECEIPT:
		After succesfull payment, send the JSON OBJECT to the database for permanent data, after that show the data from the database
		to the receipt page.

		ticket no# - will automatically be created after succesfull payment

		date booked - will get the createdAt data

		gate, bay, and trip# - will also be automatically created after succesfull payment



		JSON OBJECT SCHEMA

			USE `sessionStorage` for lcoal storage, to temporarily store user data inside an object.

			- This will be used to store the data, rather than putting the data straigthly into the database, ONLY INSERT THE DATA OF THE USER
			AFTER SUCCESSFUL PAYMENT TO AVOID UNNECESSARY DATA AND DDOS ATTACK. Use the JSON OBJECT to insert the data to the database based	
			on the `key`

			NOTE! ALWAYS NAME THE KEY THE SAME AS THE PROPERTIES (ATTIRBUTES) ON WHICH THE JSON OBJECT SCHEMA IS BASED ON.


		Based on the trip in booking.cshtml get the tripId then if the user click the `book now` use the tripId to get the data from the	
		database to be sent into an object


		Research a destination from PITX and get the average trip time, create a static set of data with fixed trip time

		Example

				PITX to Legazpi is automatically 14 hours, and will usually show within the afternnoon.

				The id of passnger will depend on the id of the user (Main Passenger)

			

			TO-DO!!!
				Use C# to automate booking List at the back end and store it in the trip table with randomize
				tripNo, gate, departrue time, and bay

				Create a randomizer from 1 to 22 and use the number to get the data from bustrip based on the id 

					bustrip data:
						BusId
						Desination 
						TotalTripTime
						Price 

					Within the booking.cs backend we will randomize tripNo, gate, departure time, and bay

					and after that store it in the trip table 


					Trip Date? How can you randomize the date? How can I separate the tomorrow trip to the other days trip?

					Let us say I will just set a maximum trip per day. Or randomize the maximum trip in a day around 
					5 to 10 only 

					And then only set the trip for tomorrow not today, because its a provincial bus trip that takes around	
					half day of a journey. Just set a message when the "Today" is chosen "No trip, for provincial trips"

					After that set the trip date range to be always from 1 - 7 days from today. Wherein, the online booking		
					will only service for a week of provincial bus trip not more or less than a week. 

					NOTE!!! If the trip departure time expires, remove it in the database, always based on the current timestamp.

					Should I store the Trip date in the table? 
						Yes, because it will be used by the system to know if it surpasses the departure time.

					Then how would I know the Trip Date of a trip?

						By getting the date today and randomizing 1 to 7 and add the number from today to get the trip date.


		NOTE!!! Clean code later!!

					JAVASCRIPT

					Create a POST request from the front-end using JavaScript to the back-end for destination Pop-up

					Wherein if I choose `Legazpi` only trips from legazpi will show



					TODO JS

						In the book now btn, create a post reqquest to the back-end, while also sending the tripId, and redirect the user to the	
						booking process, the using the tripId get the data from the database. 

						Use the ViewBag to display the data 

						And cache the json


						In the itinerary section it will call the database and store the data in a JSON Object to be reused in the 
						next section to avoid re-calling the database.

						How do you display the data from the JSON object to the front-page without using the .innerHTML??

						How do I send the JSON objecto to the next page? Using session storage

						Should I put all of the insurance data inside the trip json in the itinerary action????



						FIX TRIP CLEAN UP SERVICE!! It needs to delete all of of the trips today not just the current and past days but the whole day 
 
						Differentiate the passenger age group based on their birth of date.


						CREATE A BASE VARIABLE PRICE THE CREATE A FUNCTION FOR CALCULATING THE INSURANCE AND THE PASSENGER PAX
						SO IT IS DYNAMIC

						create a validation for each booking process
